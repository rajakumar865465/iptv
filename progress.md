# NivaTV - Recent Progress

## Mobile App Playback Bugfixes (August 2026)
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Fixed 0 FPS and buffering issue on physical Android devices by updating `player_screen.dart` to use `hwdec=auto` instead of `auto-safe`, and adding a multi-stage hardware decoder fallback cascade (`auto` -> `mediacodec` -> `no`).
- **Buffering / Token Expiry Fixes:** Fixed an infinite buffering issue occurring exactly at 2-3 minutes into playback (token expiry).
  - Ensured that fatal HTTP errors (e.g., `403 Forbidden`) instantly trigger a backend URL refresh instead of waiting for a 40-second timeout.
  - Fixed a URL comparison bug where the app was stripping `token=` parameters, causing it to incorrectly discard freshly generated stream URLs.
  - Fixed an aggressive fallback bug where standard network hiccups were bypassing silent retries. Now, temporary internet drops are given 1.5 seconds to recover automatically, while hard token expiries skip the wait.
- **Timeouts:** Reduced the default stall watchdog timeout from 40 seconds to 15 seconds.
- **Build:** Successfully compiled `app-release.apk` pointing directly to `http://44.206.18.189:5000` to bypass Nginx routing issues.

## Backend
- The backend is running on `http://44.206.18.189:5000`.
- The channels database has been recently cleared and reset during debugging.
- Advanced "Smooth Playback" (HLS proxy fallback) functionality was fully implemented in the backend.
